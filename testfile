Windows-specific questions can also be asked at Git for Windows' discussions (if in doubt whether your question is Windows-specific, or if you prefer mailing lists or want to avoid GitHub, just use the general Git mailing list). Please submit Windows-specific bugs to Git for Windows' bug tracker.

If you're a downstream packager of Git, consider joining the Git packagers mailing list for low-volume announcements from the developers, as well as other discussion related to packaging & porting Git.
